## Key Feature
  1. PWA (Progressive Web App)
  2. Fully frontend logic (due to CORS issues in the backend API)
  3. Next JS 14 with Tailwind CSS
  4. Pixel perfect from figma design
  5. Fully functionally
  6. Loading animation
  7. Horoscope and zodiac logic in frontend side
  8. When refresh the data is still

In summary, the project involved addressing CORS issues in the backend API, which prompted me to create a mockup on the frontend side to ensure seamless functionality. Despite the CORS challenges on the backend, I successfully implemented the required feature, ensuring its full functionality on the frontend.

Additionally, I created a Progressive Web App (PWA) using Next.js, allowing for an enhanced user experience with offline capabilities and faster loading times. For state management, I leveraged React Context, which provided a robust and efficient way to manage application state across components.

Furthermore, I integrated Firebase for image serving, harnessing its powerful features for efficient image management and delivery, thereby enhancing the overall performance of the application.

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
